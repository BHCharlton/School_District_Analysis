# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
In the latest academic review of schools within the district, the school board has determined that the files may have uncovered evidence of academic dishonesty within the district, specifically reading and math grades for ninth-graders attending Thomas High School.  While the extent of academic dishonesty is uncertain, the school board has reached out to Maria, our client, to do a re-analysis of grade reporting within the district, and to replace the suspect grades from Thomas High School with null values.  Maria and the school board will be able to use the new report to better understand the effects of the altered reporting, and then to make more informed decisions on school budgeting and performance within the district.
